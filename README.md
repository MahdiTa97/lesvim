In the name of Allah, most gracious and most mercifu

we want to create a pro development area so please do this instruction step by step :

firt of all thing is OS (operation system), so please install a `linux` or use `mac os`

# Why `Linux` or `Mac OS` :

[[TODO]]

We recommand :

- [using `Wezterm` as your default Terminal emulator.](https://github.com/wez/wezterm)

  It is GPU-accelerated cross-platform terminal emulator and multiplexer written by @wez and implemented in Rust

  [It's my `wezterm.lua`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hemedani/dotfiles/main/wezterm/wezterm.lua), you should put it in `$HOME/.config/wezterm/wezterm.lua` :

- [using `Fish SHELL` as your default Shell.](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell)

  It is he user-friendly command line shell.

- [using `starship` as you default Shell prompt.](https://github.com/starship/starship)

  It is the minimal, blazing-fast, and infinitely customizable prompt for any shell!

  [It's my `starship.toml`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hemedani/dotfiles/main/starship.toml), you should pu it in `$HOME/.config/starship.toml`

first of all install Neovim :

install `rust`

install `node js`

install `prettier` globally

The major problem of IDE or IDE-Like performance relate to formating document. So we try to speed up this procces as much as possible.

We trying to format document with utils writen in rust `RUST`
install `dprint` and set it to your `$PATH`
install `stylua` and set it to your `$PATH`
copy or clone this repo to `.config/nvim`

after lunching neovim install these `TreeSitter` lib with `TSInstall` :

- `TSInstall tsx`
